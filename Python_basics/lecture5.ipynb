    "# However, you need to incorporate error handling to ensure that the program gracefully handles any potential errors that may arise during the calculations.\n",

    "# Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).\n",
    "# Implement error handling mechanisms to handle the following scenarios:\n",
    "# Division by zero (ZeroDivisionError)\n",
    "# Invalid input for numbers (ValueError)\n",
    "# Invalid input for the operator (ValueError or KeyError)\n",
    "# Any other unexpected errors (Exception)\n",
    "# Include appropriate error messages for each specific error scenario.\n",
    "# Ensure that the program continues to execute and prompts the user for new input after handling an error.\n",
    "# Test the program with different inputs to ensure the error handling is working correctly."
